# To Do
Last updated: 2026-01-17

## Priority list (next 10)
1) Apply typography tokens across pages (headings, body, and secondary text).
2) Landing page: wire New Arrivals to dynamic data.
3) Review entry flow: fix search input overflow (expand/wrap/ellipsis) and close dropdown after selection.
4) Lists index: sort recent lists to the top and make list cards fully clickable.
5) Lists edit: fix "Title not found. Hydrate the title before adding it to a list." by auto-hydrating or clearer handling.
6) Lists edit: remove "Add more films" block, show review info per item, and add "Write review" link per item.

## QA notes (from testing)
- Review entry: search input can overflow and the dropdown persists after selection.
- Lists edit: add-item flow can fail with "Title not found. Hydrate the title before adding it to a list."
